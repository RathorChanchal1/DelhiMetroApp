# Delhi Metro Rail App

This is a simple Java program that helps users find the fare and shortest metro route between two stations of the Delhi Metro. The program utilizes Graph and Heap data structures to achieve this functionality.

## Features
- Takes input of source and destination stations from the user
- Displays the fare and shortest metro route to reach the destination
- Includes a metro map for commuter navigation
- Implements graph nodes and edges to represent metro stations and their connections
- Utilizes algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, and depth-first search to determine the shortest path
- Calculates fare based on the total distance between the two stations

## Files
- `Main.java`: Contains the main code for the program
- `Heap.java`: Contains the implementation of the heap data structure

## Usage
To use the program, simply run `Main.java` and follow the instructions to input the source and destination stations.

## How it Works
The program uses graph nodes to represent metro stations, with edges representing the connections between stations. By implementing various algorithms, it determines the shortest path between the source and destination stations and calculates the fare based on the total distance.
